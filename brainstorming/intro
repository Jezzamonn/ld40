LONG AGO, VIDEOGAMES WERE UNTAMED,
AND ROAMED BY LEGENDARY GAMERS!

OF ALL GAMERS, NONE SHONE BRIGHTER
THAN GAMEDEV KNIGHT

BUT THIS ENDED AT
THE TOWER OF FREEMIUM GAMES
WHEN CURSED IN GAME PURCHASES
WROUGHT A TERRIBLE MAGIC

WHEN GAMEDEV KNIGHT AWOKE,
GAMES WERE FILLED WITH LOOTBOXES
AND GOOD VIDEOGAMES WERE GONE

THEIR SPIRIT BROKEN,
A GRIEVING GAMEDEV KNIGHT
WENT INTO A LIFE OF SOLITUDE

BUT WITHOUT GOOD GAMEDEVS, THE LAND
WAS SEIZED BY A VILE POWER:
THE WALKING SIMULATORS AND THEIR
ORDER OF NO GAMEPLAY

BUT GAMEDEV KNIGHT HAD A PLAN

RELEASE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF GAMES
SO HORRENDOUSLY BAD, THAT NO ONE
WOULD EVER PLAY ANY VIDEOGAME AGAIN

AND SO HE BECAME....
